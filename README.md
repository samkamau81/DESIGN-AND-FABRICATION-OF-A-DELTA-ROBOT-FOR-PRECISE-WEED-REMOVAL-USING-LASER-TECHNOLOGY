# DESIGN-AND-FABRICATION-OF-A-DELTA-ROBOT-FOR-PRECISE-WEED-REMOVAL-USING-LASER-TECHNOLOGY

Weed infestations pose a significant threat to agricultural productivity by competing
with crops for essential resources such as nutrients, water, and sunlight. Traditional
weed management methods, including manual weeding and chemical herbicides, are often
inefficient, labor-intensive, and harmful to the environment. Manual weeding is costly and
time-consuming, while chemical herbicides contribute to soil degradation, water pollution,
and the development of resistant weed strains. As a result, there is a growing need for
sustainable and precise alternatives that minimize the use of harmful chemicals and reduce
ecological impacts. 

This project addresses this research gap by developing an automated, eco-friendly system
for weed management using a combination of robot technology, laser weed removal, and
AI-powered computer vision. The objective is to design a system capable of highly precise,
chemical-free weed removal that is powered by renewable energy sources such as solar
power. Current automated systems often lack the precision needed to avoid damaging
crops and have environmental drawbacks. In contrast, the proposed solution integrates
delta robots for high-speed movement and laser technology for targeted weed removal,
which minimizes soil disturbance and offers greater control over weed management. 
AI driven computer vision allows for real-time identification of weeds, ensuring that only the
intended targets are affected by the laser system.

This development holds potential implications for the agricultural sector, enabling smalland medium-scale farms to adopt sustainable practices without compromising efficiency.
By minimizing environmental harm and improving accuracy, this system offers a practical
and long-term solution to the challenges of modern weed management.
